Run Your Application:

When you run your application, Log4j will create the log file (e.g., myapp.log) and write log messages according to the configuration you defined.

Make sure to adjust the configuration and log levels in your log4j.xml file to suit your specific logging requirements. Additionally, handle any exceptions related to Log4j initialization properly in your application.
